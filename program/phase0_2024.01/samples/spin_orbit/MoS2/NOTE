collinear/scf
   The spin-orbit interation is applied at the post process.
   zaj_socsv.data is generated by setting sw_write_zaj_socsv = on.

collinear/band
   The spin-orbit interation is applied at the post process.


##################################
noncollinear/scf
   The spin-orbit interation is applied in a self-consistent manner.
   Initial wave functions are atomic orbitals.

noncollinear/band
   band calculation with spin-orbit


##################################
noncollinear_read_file/scf 
   The spin-orbit interation is applied in a self-consistent manner.

   Initial wave functions are read from a file (zaj_socsv.data),
   which is copied from collinear/scf directory.
